//  BPatch_eventLock
//  
//  This class forms a base class for most DyninstAPI classes and is currently
//  responsible for managing a global mutex variable which controls access to 
//  _all_ internal dyninst/paradyn data structures.
//
//  It works in conjunction with the locking macros to isolate all mutex operations,
//  but can be used seperately as needed (should not be necessary, think twice).
//
//  Eventually may become more specialized if we move to a finer-grain of data locking.

//      or else they will not be distinguishible (type-wise) overloads.
//  w:  The list of arguments passed to the wrapped function.  Really just the 
//      argument list without type information.
//  t:  Return type of the function
//  x:  The name of the function as exported to the API user.  The "internal",
//      ie unlocked function prototype is constructed by appending arg <z> to this.
//  y:  The parameter list for the function exported to the API user.
