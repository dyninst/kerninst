RELEASE 2.1.1 NOTES
-------------------

* Binary Distributions

The KernInst 2.1.1 binary distributions contain binaries that are
statically-linked with LGPL'd libraries (libstdc++, libgcc). In
compliance with the LGPL, we make available on our website 
the source to these libraries and our own source code. We also
statically link with the Tcl/Tk and X11 libraries, and provide
the actual libaries we built with on our website for those who
wish to obtain them. 

Included with the binary distributions are prebuilt versions of
various Paradyn components (libpdutil, visualizations). These
components are licensed by us (see LICENSE.Paradyn).

The Linux distributions also statically link with libelf
in order to avoid problems between differing versions of the 
library provided by the various Linux distributions. The prebuilt
library and source code for this version of libelf is available
on our website.

Note that the release binaries are dynamically linked to libc
version 2.3.2. This means that older systems having only libc
version 2.2.x will not be able to run our binaries. Please upgrade
your libc version if this is the case, or download the source
distribution and build it with your version of libc.

* Source Distribution

The entire source code and build structure necessary to build all
components of KernInst is included in the source distribution. The
source distribution thus contains some portions of the Paradyn source
code, which are licensed by us (see LICENSE.Paradyn).
