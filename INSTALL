How To Install KernInst 2.1.1
-----------------------------

* Binary Distribution

If you have unpacked the binary distribution, you're basically done
installing already. The KernInst binaries do not require any special 
placement in the filesystem, so they can be run directly from the 
distribution directories. For details on running KernInst, refer to 
the user's guide in the 'docs' directory.

* Source Distribution

After unpacking the source distribution, you will need to build the
various KernInst components. Refer to 'BUILD_GUIDE' in the 'docs'
directory for instructions. After you have completed building, you
are ready to run KernInst. Details on how to run KernInst can be found
in the user's guide in the 'docs' directory.
