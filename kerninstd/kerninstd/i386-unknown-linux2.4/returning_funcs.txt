// Kernel functions that return on behalf of callers.
// Examples: .stret4 ("structure return 4 bytes")
// The first entry of the 3-tuple is always blank in this file
// (Just to keep the format the same as skips.txt; don't sweat the details)
// Note that the last line has to end in a comma, but if you add a comment
// after that comma, you can avoid a spurious cout warning being printed
// to the screen: "unknown start of command"

//   {"", "unix", ".stret4"},
//   {"", "unix", ".stret8"},

     {"", "kernel", "panic"}, // doesn't really return for the caller, but
                              // we do want the basicblock to end at the call

// hello world (comment at end of file to avoid spurious cout warning)
